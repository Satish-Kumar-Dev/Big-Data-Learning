=========================== Big Data ===========================
1. What is Big Data?
Ans: Big Data is the large set of data where we can't handle the data in traditional methods.
	Big data is a So large, fast or complex which is difficult to process using traditionalm methods.
	Size of Big data is form GB's to PB's where TB = Tera Bytes and PB = Peta Bytes
	Big Data comes from : 
		1: Social Media
		2: E-commerce
		3: Banks, Credit card trasactions etc.,
	Importance of Big Data:
		1: Time Reduction
		2: Analysis of Big Data
		3: Cost Reduction
		4: Smart Decision Making
		
		
2: 7 V's of Big Data?
Ans: 1. Volume: Volume of the data
	 2. Velocity: Speed of the Response we can Simply say in that way
	 3. Veriety: Different Structures of the Data like Structured, Unstructured Data and Semi Structured Data
	 4. Veracity: Data with Ambiguity or Errors. How much the Data is Trustworthy to take
	 5. Value: Value of the Raw Data
	 6. Visualisation: Displaying data in the form of charts, graphs, map and similar form of visualisations.
						To understand the data we need to visualise the data
	 7. Virality: People to People Network means where nodes are connected directly to one each other.
					Virality means how fast the data can be shared via people to people network.
	 
3: Types of Data under Big Data?
Ans: 1. Structured Data: The data which is stored, accessed and processed using a fixed method is then it is called a Structured data. 
		Example: Data form a Relational Database table.
	 2. Unstructured Data: The Data which don't have any proper format is called a Unstructured data.
		Example: CC Tv footage, Audio Files etc.,
	 3. Semi Structured Data: This is the combination of both structured data and unstructured data.
		Example: JSON files, XML files etc.,
